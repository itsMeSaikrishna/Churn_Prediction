# Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction Dashboard

A comprehensive data science project focused on predicting customer attrition using statistical feature selection and machine learning. This repository includes extensive EDA, advanced statistical testing, and a deployed Streamlit interface for real-time predictions.

## 📊 Methodology & Pipeline
Our approach followed a rigorous statistical pipeline to ensure model reliability:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Deep dive into churn drivers and distribution.
2. **Feature Selection:** - **Numerical:** Mann-Whitney U Test to drop non-significant features.
   - **Categorical:** Chi-Square tests for independence.
   - **Multicollinearity:** Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and Correlation Matrices.
3. **Pre-processing:** Feature extraction and Scikit-learn Pipeline construction.
4. **Imbalance Handling:** Utilized **SMOTE-NC** (or SMOTETomek) to address class imbalance.
5. **Modeling & Tuning:** Trained XGBoost and ExtraTreesClassifier with **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter optimization.

## 📈 Model Performance

### Dataset 1: XGBoost (Focus on Recall)
* **ROC-AUC:** 0.818
* **Recall:** 0.828 (Prioritizing capturing as many churners as possible)
* **Accuracy:** 71.5%

### Dataset 2: RandomForest (High Precision/Accuracy)
* **Accuracy:** 97.75%
* **F1-Score (Class 1):** 0.92
* **Precision:** 0.97

## 🚀 Deployment
The model is deployed via a **Streamlit** web interface, allowing users to:
- Input customer attributes for real-time churn probability.
- Perform large-scale batch data analysis.
